# Limits and Usage Quotas

To ensure fair usage and maintain the performance of the ForVoyez API, we have implemented request limits and usage quotas. In this section, we'll discuss the request limits per subscription, how to handle quota overages, and the possibility to purchase additional credit packs.

## Request Limits per Subscription

Each subscription plan has a specific credit limit that determines the maximum number of API requests you can make within a given time period. Here are the credit limits for our subscription plans:

- Silver Monthly Plan: 1,000 credits per month
- Silver Annual Plan: 12,000 credits per year (equivalent to 1,000 per month)
- Sapphire Monthly Plan: 10,000 credits per month
- Sapphire Annual Plan: 120,000 credits per year (equivalent to 10,000 per month)

If you exceed the credit limit for your subscription plan, the API will return a `401 Unauthorized, no credit left` error. It's important to monitor your usage and upgrade your subscription plan if needed to avoid interruptions in your service.

## Handling Quota Overages

If you exceed your monthly credit quota, you have a few options to continue using the ForVoyez API:

1. Wait until the next billing cycle: If you can wait until your quota resets in the next billing cycle, you can pause your usage or limit your requests to essential operations.

2. Upgrade your subscription plan: If you consistently exceed your quota, consider upgrading from Silver to Sapphire plan that offers more credits per month. This will give you a larger quota to work with and help you avoid overages.

3. Purchase additional credit packs: If you need a temporary boost in your credit quota, you can purchase additional credit packs. Credit packs are one-time purchases that add a specific number of credits to your quota for the current billing cycle.

## Purchasing Additional Credit Packs

If you're already subscribed to a plan and need more credits, you can purchase additional credit packs. Credit packs are available in the following options:

- Refill 1,000: 1,000 additional credits
- Refill 3,300: 3,300 additional credits
- Refill 10,000: 10,000 additional credits

To purchase a credit pack:

1. Log in to your ForVoyez account and navigate to the [Billing](https://forvoyez.com/app/plans) section.
2. Click on the "Purchase Credit Pack" button.
3. Select the desired credit pack option and complete the payment process.

The additional credits will be added to your quota instantly, and you can continue using the API without interruption.

Please note that credit packs are non-refundable and expire at the end of the billing cycle. Unused credits from credit packs do not roll over to the next billing cycle.

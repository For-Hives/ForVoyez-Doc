# Error Codes

When making requests to the ForVoyez API, you may encounter various error codes and error messages that indicate the status of your request. This page provides a comprehensive list of the error codes and messages you may receive, along with their descriptions and possible solutions.

## HTTP Status Codes

The ForVoyez API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Here are the common status codes you may encounter:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid or cannot be served.
- `401 Unauthorized`: The request lacks valid authentication credentials.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

## ForVoyez API Error Messages

In addition to the standard HTTP status codes, the ForVoyez API returns specific error messages in the response body to provide more detailed information about the error. These error messages are accompanied by the corresponding HTTP status code.

Example error response:
